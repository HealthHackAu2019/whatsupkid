This folder contains a sample dashboard and data set for nurses/clinicians to utilise the data generated by the patient app.

The dashbaord is built in Tableau and exported as a packaged workbook that can be viewed by downloading the free Tableau reader.

The data is dummy data compiled manually. To be replaced with real data later on.

The concept is to show the pain level profile, feelings and needs over time. 

This will help to understand changes over time and potentially allow predicitive features to be built in the future.
