# What's Up Kid?

This is a prototype for an app that helps sick kids communicate how they're feeling to their parents, nurses, and doctors.

It attempts to solve the problem of kids struggling to vocalise their symptoms or experience, either due to being too young, being too stressed or not being familiar enough with the carer.
